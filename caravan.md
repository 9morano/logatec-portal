# VESNA Based Smart Caravan

Jozef Stefan Institute and Adria Mobil, one of the leading European manufacturers of motorhomes, are collaboratively developing an intelligent motorhome. The novel motorhome concept, which is referred to as *Adria moving lab*, focuses on the low energy consumption and intelligent software that automates the motorhome and improves user experience. The goal is to build a smart motorhome that understands user needs, adapts to its users and consequently improves the comfort, safety and energy efficiency. The motorhome is equipped with multiple [VESNA](http://sensorlab.ijs.si/hardware.html) hardware platforms â€“ developed by SensorLab, connected into a wireless sensor network, gathering the data and forwarding it to software for real-time data analysis based on the [QMiner](http://qminer.ijs.si/) data analytics platform which is compiled for the RPi and AI reasoning. The new integrated technology upgrades an existing service and enables smarter use of a renewable energy sources and more flexible control over heating, lighting, water supply etc...

One of the main goals of this set-up is to improve the overall energy consumption of the vehicle, thus making it at least 10% more energy efficient. Several VESNAs are placed to monitor the energy consumption of various devices and also on the main power lines. Consumption patterns are learnt and, by using also alternative data such as temperature and illuminance, the system is able to predict how long the batteries will last with the current batteries.
