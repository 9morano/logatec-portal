LOG-a-TEC covers a set of diverse testbeds used for research purposes. It initially started 7 years ago as an outdoor environmental sensing facility, it evolved towards [spectrum sensing and cognitive radio](ap-cradio.html) as its largest component. It is also covering application areas (verticals) such as [photovoltaics](ap-pv.html), [air quality](ap-aqa.html) and [automotive](ap-caravan.html). More recently, it is evolving towards a comprehensive heterogeneous [M2M/MTC/dense IoT setup](ap-mtc.html) comprising LR-WPAN and LPWAN technologies. The one thing all setups have in common is that they are based on a version of the [VESNA hardware platform](hw-vesna.html) which can be used as standalone or combined with other more powerful machines. VESNA is a modular and configurable embedded hardware platform developed by [SensorLab] (http://sensorlab.ijs.si/hardware.html).
