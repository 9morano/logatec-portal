  <p>LOG-a-TEC covers a set of diverse testbeds used for research purposes. The testbeds are mostly based on the <a href="http://sensorlab.ijs.si/hardware.html">VESNA hardware platform</a> - developed by SensorLab.
  </p>

 <p>The testbeds currently consist of 70-80 sensor nodes installed outdoors, mostly on light poles and rooftops in different regions of Slovenia. They allow remote monitoring, reconfiguration and experimentation. The application area range from environmental monitoring, smarts grids to cognitive radio experimentation.
